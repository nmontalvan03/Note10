#  Automatic Scaling and Monitoring

Ensures that the application has the computing capacity it needs and eliminates any need to monitor
manually the serviceability. Therefore, it is a process where dynamic resources are assigned to satisfy performance requirements and also increase
the volume of work, applications that require more resources to maintain performance levels
and comply with service level agreements.

# Monitoring with CloudWatch

allows you to create alarms to take actions about the infrastructure resources that are deployed
to record monitoring logs using custom files and also to create rules that indicate
events of interest, however cloudWatch is responsible for monitoring the AWS resources and applications that are
They execute in real time.

For example:

- Get alerts when things go wrong
- View metrics for where resources are being allocated
- Create our own dashboards
- Create events based on monitoring
- Set alarms based on usage, or money spent

# Load Balancing

Is responsible for distributing computational workloads between two or more computers for the purpose
Load balancing to divide network traffic between multiple servers, reducing stress on each server and
make them more efficient and have good performance in links to external sites and reduce the latency of
links to an external site by balancing the load which is very essential for that  applications work correctly without any difficulty.

Type of load Balancer

- Load Balancing  Spreads out network traffic among multiple servers
- Also provides redundancy  One server goes down, no break in services
- Most AWS Services are offered with a ”built-in” redundancy…     EXCEPT for EC2!!

- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Network Load Balancer (NLB)

# IT Monitoring

Determines what is tied into the IT infrastructure at an external site and how the underlying components
They work in real time. however, this allows users to identify IT problems in real time and thus make 
decisions since they are key to maintaining security, profitability and guaranteeing the stability and reputation of said companies.

IT monitoring technologies often have three major components:

- Sensors that generate raw data from network nodes
- Analytics solutions that process this data into information
- UI interfaces that visualize intuitive and insightful reports

Types of IT monitoring

- System monitoring
-Dependency monitoring
- Integration and API monitoring
- Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)
- Web performance monitoring
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Security monitoring
- IT monitoring in modern SDLC frameworks

# Auto Scaling

It is a cloud computing technique to dynamically allocate computational resources, they are services
website for developers and system administrators who need a solution for automatic scaling
which allows them to optimize the use of cloud resources and be more efficient.

In this module I learned the importance and what autoscaling is for in AWS, what is its infrastructure, types of IT
monitoring and how to create an alarm in AWS and use each Amazon web service since this explains
the process and function that each automatic scaling and monitoring has.

which should be no alarm is activated when creating it?
